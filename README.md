# Road Network kNN Experimental Evaluation Datasets

This repository contains several datasets that can be used in the [Road Network kNN Experimental Evaluation] (https://github.com/tenindra/rn_knn_exp). These datasets were obtained from the sources stated below. All datasets are largely unchanged, but have been re-formatted for use in the experimental evaluation.

* The DE, ME, VT and NW road network datasets were obtained from TIGER/Line data made available by the [9th DIMACS Challenge] (http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/challenge9/data/tiger/). These datasets have been transformed to the DIMACS format.
* The real-world POI datasets were extracted from the [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org) ([Â© OpenStreetMap contributors](http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright)) database by [Gisgraphy] (http://www.gisgraphy.com/). These have been mapped to the respective DIMACS road networks.
